Write a C program to find all palindrome words in a given sentence.
Your program should prompt the user to enter a sentence and then output all the palindrome words found in that sentence.

For example:

If the user enters: "A man a plan a canal Panama"
the program should output: "A", "a", "a"
If the user enters: "Madam, in Eden, I'm Adam"
the program should output: "Madam"
